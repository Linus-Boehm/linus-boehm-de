# Linus Boehm Website

Hey! This is the repository of my personal Portfolio.
You can see the live version at [linusboehm.de](https://linusboehm.de)

## Tech Stack

This portfolio website is build with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/). 
Instead of using popular UI library like [Material UI](https://mui.com/) or [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/),
I choose to use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) which is utility-first CSS framework. This allows
to build a flexible and custom UI with a very small bundle size. To integrate tailwindcss with [emotion](https://emotion.sh/), I used
[twin.macro](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro).

This project was initial created from the nextjs sample provided with emotion and tailwind 
[examples/with-tailwindcss](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss/README.md).
